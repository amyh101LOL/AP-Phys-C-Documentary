            <h2>WELCOME</h2>

            <p>Hey, I'm Amy! I made the super rash decision of self-studying AP Physics C: M (C:M for short) on my own because... why not?
              We've already suffered through AP Physics 1; how bad can C:M be...? *chuckles nervously*
            </p>
            <p>
              Anyway, the point of this website is to blog/document how we've been doing, any challenges I've faced, the Calculus-related points of C:M, and so on.
              If you're just like us and want to try your hand at C:M, feel free to use this website as a resource, and good luck to you all! üôÇüëç

            <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>

            <div class="intros">
              <p>Hi (again), I'm Amy, the developer of this website and aforementioned high schooler. When I'm not putting myself through pain learning C:M,
                I enjoy doing some other things like playing video games, drawing, touching grass, etc. Regarding video games, I love all kinds of genres:
                rhythm, adventure/RPG, horror/thriller, first-person shooter, and sandbox. My all-time favorites include Project Sekai, Roblox, Minecraft, Valorant, and more!
                As "sweaty" as some of these games may seem, they're relaxing to me and provide a small reprise in times of difficulty (like AP Physics 1. Dark times, those were.)
              </p>
